# Miro plugin: codeBeamer integration

This is a codeBeamer <-> Miro integration web-plugin to be installed on Miro.
It allows to import codeBeamer items to a Miro board, displaying any associations between the items.

The goal is to make this plugin at least as powerful as the [Miro-Jira plugin](https://miro.com/works-with-atlassian/)


More info to come! Stay tuned...
